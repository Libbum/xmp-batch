# xmp-batch

Batch apply xmp licensing to a glob of files.

For the moment this is just getting me over the line of something I want to be able to do smoothly enough: tag images with Creative Commons metadata.

Later on, maybe I'll add some command line interfaces, the ability to read CC `xmp` files directly etc.
Comment on those issues if you want to help out there or poke me to actually go and do that so you can use this tool.
